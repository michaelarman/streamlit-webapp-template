# streamlit-webapp-template

This was a guided project I took on coursera. It taught me about the cool things that streamlit could do 
and all of it is done without the use of any HTML, CSS or Javascript. I found streamlit a much easier way of making a webapp than 
using Flask, Bootstrap and the like.

## Installations
All packages needed are listed in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/michaelarman/streamlit-webapp-template/blob/master/requirements.txt)
There are only 5 required packages but you can add more visualization packages if desired. 

## Procedure
To run the streamlit webapp all you need to do is clone the repo and run:
 ``` streamlit run learner_script.py ```
 After that you should see a link or the webpage should pop up on its own.
